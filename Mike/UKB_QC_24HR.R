### MF: This is a script for generating lists of UK Biobank participants which meet QC/filtering criteria.

###This script has two parts. In part A, QC filtering of paritcipants.
###Part B filters participants based on if they completed the 24H recall survey.



##===============================PART A=================================================
#Generate a list of participants who pass the following QC criteria:
#1.Genetic ethnicity = Caucasian
#2. Used in PCA analysis
#3. Not an outlier for heterogeneity and missing genotype rate (poor quality genotype)
#4. No Sex chromosome aneuploidy
#5. Do not have high degree of genetic kinship (Ten or more third-degree relatives identified)
#6. Self-reported sex matches genetic sex
#7. Does not appear in "maximum_set_of_unrelated_individuals.MF.pl"
#Adding self-reported white British/Irish/White was not necessary after
#these steps as all remaining participants are self-reported British
